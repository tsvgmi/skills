title: Setup per directory history and search
date:  2023-06-14

I work on command line and relie aon history often to re-execute old command.  By default, history has limited
store and not pesistent.  Also the content are all jumbled together making the historical search limited to only recent use.

## Requirements

* A different history per working directory. 
* Long persistency (across sessions, reboot)
* Ability to search back as far as storage allowed
* Can retain history even after changing to different machine (work in environment where my laptop are refreshed
  every few years with empty content.
* zsh only (may work with other shell, but I don't use them)

## Solution

* Keep history persistent as in a dedicated directory
* Switch history location whenever directory is changed
* Reset history to this updated history content
* Tool to search history

History files are generally very small, and it's possible to keep it many years as well.
_Note: Make sure you don't put sensitive information in command line as this is also retained.  This is standard
issue in shell history - but in this case is worse because history is kept persistent_

### Keeping history

* Make ~/.tool the directory to maintain history
* History will be kept at ~/.tool/hist-#{basename_of_working_dir}
* Keep large history

```
# Example only (man zshutbuiltins - search for fc for more details)
export HISTFILE=~/.tool/hist-${PWD##*/}
export HISTSIZE=1000
unset SAVEHIST
```
zsh interactive shell will call chpwd function when user change directory.  So we just implement the function

```
# Change location and flush
function chpwd {
  fc -W
  export HISTFILE=$HOME/.tool/hist-${PWD##*/}
  export HISTSIZE=1000
  fc -R
}
```

* Arrange for the functon to be loaded at interactive session start (put in ~/.zshrc)
* Now whenever you switch to a new diorectory and run ```history``` or ```fc -l`, you'll only see the history of
  commands issued in that directory only

### Searching History

Defne a function to allow for searching of history

* hsearch regexp - Search for the pattern in current directory
* hsearch -a regexp - Search for the  pattern in all directory
* hsearch -d <wdir> regexp - Search for the pattern in the specified directory
  
The output shows the history, and when it was running, order by time.   I also put in a cut filter to avoid some
very long history record.  This is normally resulted from some erroreous cut/paste which are recored.   Normal
command should not be that long.

```
hsearch () {
        typeset ld=${PWD##*/}
        typeset sall
        while getopts :ad: i
        do
                case $i in
                        (a) sall=yes  ;;
                        (d) ld=$OPTARG  ;;
                esac
        done
        let j=$OPTIND-1
        shift $j
        OPTIND=0
        typeset pattern=$@
        if [ "$sall" ]
        then
                set -- $(echo $HOME/.tool/hist-*)
        else
                set -- $HOME/.tool/hist-$ld
        fi
        ruby -e '
    pattern = Regexp.new(ARGV.shift)
    cmdset  = {}
    while file = ARGV.shift
      next unless test(?f, file)
      fid = File.open(file)
      while line = fid.gets do
        next unless line[0] == ":"
        line = line.encode("UTF-8", invalid: :replace)
        tmp, ts, stat, cmd = line.chomp.split(/[:;]/, 4)
        next unless cmd =~ pattern
        next if cmdset[cmd]
        cmdset[cmd] = true
        time = Time.at(ts.to_i)
        puts "%s %10.10s | %s" % [time.strftime("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S"),
          File.basename(file).sub(/^hist-/o, ""), cmd]
      end
    end
  ' "$pattern" "$@" | sort | cut -c1-256
}
```
